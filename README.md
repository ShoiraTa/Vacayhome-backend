## Built With

- Ruby version 3.1.1
- RoR version 7
## Getting Started

The API will receive POST requests to create Houses and Bookings and GET requests to view Houses and Bookings.
The base URL is: https://vacayhome-api.herokuapp.com

If you want to view Houses you can call this endpoint:

/api/v1/houses

To do the same but with bookings call this endpoint:

/api/v1/bookings

Both endpoints will return a JSON response with the following format:

```
For Houses:
{
  "id":1,
  "name":"Cool House",
  "price":"100.0",
  "description":"This is a cool House",
  "country":"US",
  "city":"Los Angeles",
  "address":"100 cool street",
  "property_type":"house",
  "image_url":"https://exampleimage.com",
  "created_at":"2022-04-05T13:13:11.814Z",
  "updated_at":"2022-04-05T13:13:11.814Z"
}

For Bookings:
{
  "id":1,
  "date":"2022-04-06",
  "created_at":"2022-04-06T17:37:29.310Z",
  "updated_at":"2022-04-06T17:37:29.310Z",
  "user_id":1,
  "house_id":1
}
```

You can view a specific House by calling this endpoint:

/api/v1/houses/:id

Same goes for Booking:

/api/v1/bookings/:id

**If you need further information about the endpoints you can view the documentation navigating to `/api-docs`.
Or you can just click this [link](https://vacayhome-api.herokuapp.com/api-docs/index.html)**

If you prefer to clone the project locally, you can also get to the docs by navigating to http://`domain`:`port`/api-docs. Where `domain` is the domain of your server and `port` is the port of your server.
For example, if your server is running on port 3000, you can navigate to http://localhost:3000/api-docs.
There you will see a list of all endpoints and their descriptions.
